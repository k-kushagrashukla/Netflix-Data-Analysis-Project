# Netflix Movie Data Analyst Project
Netflix, founded on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California, by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, began as a DVD-by-mail service. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, co-founded the company after being inspired by a hefty late fee from a traditional video rental store. Randolph, a marketing executive, played a pivotal role in shaping Netflix's early user interface and branding.

Netflix is known for its work in data science, AI, and ML, particularly for building strong recommendation models and algorithms that understand customer behavior and patterns. Suppose you are working in a data-driven job role, and you have a dataset of more than 9,000 movies. You need to solve the following questions to help the company make informed business decisions accordingly.

1)-What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?

2)-Which has highest votes in vote avg column?

3)-What movie got the highest popularity? what's its genre?

4)-What movie got the lowest popularity? what's its genre?

5)-Which year has the most filmmed movies?

## Hence , for answering these question We need to analyse  and clean our dataset 
  using these python libraries and modules ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

  ```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
### numpy : library for calculating mathematical operation
### pandas : for data cleaning
### matplotlib and seaborn : for graph reprsentaion
